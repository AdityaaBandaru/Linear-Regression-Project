# 🎓 Student Score Prediction using Linear Regression

This project applies a simple linear regression model to predict student test scores based on the number of hours they study. It demonstrates the use of supervised learning for regression tasks with clear visualizations and model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict a student's test score given their study hours.
- **Technique:** Simple Linear Regression
- **Dataset:** Custom dataset of 15 students with `Hours_Studied` and `Test_Score`

---
## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Scatter plot and correlation analysis
2. **Model Building**
   - Trained linear regression model using `sklearn`
3. **Visualization**
   - Regression line over scatter plot
   - Residual plot
## 📈 Results

- The model shows a strong positive linear relationship between study hours and scores.
- It can reasonably predict scores for new data within the training range.
